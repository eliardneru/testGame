### this thing is the project structure, im figuring out how to refactor this thing

game loop VVV
create and handle player and data -> Texture
handle player input -> handle player physics < universal physics? need gdd to figure it out
create solid objects ->? Texture

- refactor the code... again!!! DONT FORGET THE VECTOR THINGY
- figure out vector thingy



- HOLY SHIT I FORGOT ABOUT THE VECTOR THINGY
- create elevators and make sure the physics is good
- configure imGui for debug and fun stuff
- create some sort of free function that frees all unused data, maybe just run vector in all players are enemies?
- add friction so the character does not slide
- figure out how to get the mouse's position
- add gun to characters hand
- create camera
- figure out how to create levels somehow by creating some primimitive level editor?
- save level to file
- add shooting
- add sound
- reconfigure CMake, make so its the users burden to download SDL2 and SDL2_Image with find_package()
- figure out how to make good binaries
- create acceleration of running and deaceleration
- make basic programmer art, animations?
- figure out sprite sheets with json? i don't want to get the position of each sprite manually
- figure out animations, probably will be killed with figure out sprite sheets
